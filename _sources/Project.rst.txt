Project
=======================================================

A significant portion of the grade will be allocated to the project component of the course. The students will form groups of 1-3 depending upon enrollment. Towards the middle of the semester, a list of project ideas will be released. The students will choose one project which is of interest to them. Alternatively, students can also pursue a different project idea. If so, then the project group is expected to submit a one-page write-up of the project idea, the computer vision tasks involved, and benchmark requirements. The students will be allowed to work on this project if the instructors feel that it adheres to the standards of the course and the department. Each project group will do two presentations. The first will be to introduce the project and to present the literature review. students will discuss the results and finding during the final presentation. Each group will be expected to submit code, documentation and research-style project report at the end of the semester. The software requirement will be updated later.

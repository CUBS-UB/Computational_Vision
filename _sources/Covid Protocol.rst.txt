Covid Protocol
=======================================================

Effective Aug. 3, the University at Buffalo will require all students, employees and visitors – regardless of their vaccination status – to wear face coverings while inside campus buildings. This includes classrooms, hallways, libraries and other common spaces, as well as UB buses and shuttles. Students are expected to wear mask in class during lectures (unless you have a UB approved exception)


The university is not requiring physical distancing indoors, because being fully vaccinated and wearing a face covering provides excellent protection for our campus community, in addition to hand washing and staying home when feeling sick.

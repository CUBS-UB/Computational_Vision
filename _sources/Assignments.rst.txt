Assignments
============


 To familiarize students with the recent advancements in computer vision, there will be three programming assignments during the initial half of the course.

PA - 1
-------------
 This assignment will focus on the fundamentals of deep learning. The students will implement different types of layers that form the building blocks of neural networks using NumPy. Furthermore, the students will create a neural network with these layers and train it using the Backpropagation algorithm.

PA - 2
-------------

 The students will explore different aspects of object recognition in this assignment. They will work with TensorFlow, Pytorch, or Keras to implement a custom object recognition model. Additionally, they will use methods in Transfer Learning and Deep Metric Learning to further improve the performance on standard datasets.
